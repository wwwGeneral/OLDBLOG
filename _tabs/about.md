Following my computer science studies, I went on to study cybersecurity at an engineering school.

At the beginning of my M1, I discovered pentesting through TryHackMe and I loved it.

Then I did some CTF and kept learning more and more about pentesting.

At some point, I took a course on pentesting in Active Directory environment and I fell in love with AD pentesting that day.

I did some internships to strengthen my knowledge in this field.

If you have a job to offer me, please don't hesitate to contact me directly to discuss it !
