Following my computer science studies, I went on to study cybersecurity at an engineering school.

At the beginning of my M1, I discovered pentesting through TryHackMe and I loved it.

Then I did some CTF and kept learning more and more about pentesting.

At some point, I took a course on pentesting in Active Directory environment and I fell in love with AD pentesting that day.

I did some internships to strengthen my knowledge in this field.

I'm currently in my last year (M2) and I'm excited to soon work in the offensive security world.

If you have a job to offer me, please don't hesitate to contact me directly to discuss it !
