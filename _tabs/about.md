Following my computer science studies, I went on to study cybersecurity at an engineering school.

At the beginning of my M1 I discovered pentesting through tryhackme and I loved it.

Then I did some CTF and I continue to learn more and more about pentesting.

At some point I took a course on pentesting in Active Directory environment and since that day I'm in love with AD pentesting.

I did some internships to strengthen my knowledge in this field.

At this time i'm in my last year (M2) and I'm excited to soon work in the offensive security world.

If you have a job to offer me, contact me and we'll see together!
